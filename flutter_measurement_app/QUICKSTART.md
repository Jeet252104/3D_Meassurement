```bash
# In another terminal
cd C:\Users\harsh\Downloads\3D-measurement-main\3D-measurement-main
python main.py serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

---

## Step 5: Get Your IP
**Windows:** `ipconfig` → Look for IPv4 Address  
**Mac/Linux:** `ifconfig` → Look for inet address

## Troubleshooting Quick Fixes

### "flutter: command not found"
```bash
# Add Flutter to PATH
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/flutter/bin"
```

### "No devices found"
- Check USB debugging enabled
- Try different USB cable/port
- Run: `adb devices`

### "Cannot connect to server"
- Both on same WiFi?
- Server running?
- Correct IP?
- Test in browser: `http://YOUR_IP:8000`

### "Camera permission denied"
- Settings → Apps → 3D Measurement → Permissions → Camera → Allow
