## 📸 Capture Process

### Step 1: Prepare Object
- Place object on flat, stable surface
- Clear background (plain wall or table)
- Ensure good lighting (bright, no harsh shadows)
- Remove nearby clutter

### Step 2: Start Capture
1. From home screen, tap **Start Measurement**
2. Camera opens with instructions overlay
3. Read the on-screen instructions:
   - "Position the object in frame"
   - "Stand about 50-70cm away"
   - "Walk slowly in a complete circle"

### Step 3: Position Yourself
- Stand **50-70cm** (arm's length) from object
- Keep object centered in camera view
- Hold phone at comfortable height
- Make sure object is fully visible

### Step 4: Begin Auto-Capture
- Tap **Start Auto-Capture** button
- Countdown begins
- **Start walking slowly** in a circle around object

### Step 5: During Capture (30 seconds)
**What You'll See:**
- Circular progress indicator
- Percentage (0% → 100%)
- Photo counter (e.g., "5 / 20 photos")
- Guidance messages:
  - "Hold steady" - Stop moving briefly
  - "Move slower" - You're going too fast
  - "Move faster" - Speed up a bit
  - "Perfect! Keep going" - Good pace

**What You Should Do:**
- Walk in a smooth circle
- Keep same distance from object
- Hold phone steady (don't shake)
- Maintain same height
- Complete full 360° circle
- Let app capture automatically (no need to tap)

### Step 6: Upload & Processing
**After 20 photos captured:**
- Screen shows "Uploading... X%"
- Photos compress automatically
- Upload progress: 0% → 100%
- Then: "Processing on server..."
- Time estimate: "This may take 60-90 seconds"

**What's Happening:**
1. Images compressed (~70% size reduction)
2. Uploaded to server
3. Server processes with GPU
4. 3D reconstruction created
5. Measurements calculated

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### Lighting
✅ **Good**: Bright, even lighting (natural daylight or multiple lamps)  
❌ **Bad**: Dim lighting, single harsh light, direct sunlight creating shadows

### Distance
✅ **Good**: 50-70cm (arm's length), consistent throughout  
❌ **Bad**: Too close (<30cm), too far (>1m), changing distance

### Movement
✅ **Good**: Slow, steady walk in smooth circle  
❌ **Bad**: Fast movement, jerky stops, incomplete circle

### Object Placement
✅ **Good**: Stable surface, plain background, clear space around  
❌ **Bad**: Cluttered background, unstable placement, multiple objects

### Camera Technique
✅ **Good**: Hold steady, same height, object centered  
❌ **Bad**: Shaking, changing height, object at edge of frame

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to server"

**What it means**: App can't reach the server  

**Check:**
1. Is server running? (Ask admin)
2. Are you on the same WiFi as server?
3. Is the URL correct in Settings?

**Try:**
1. Tap Settings → Test Connection
2. Try different WiFi network
3. Ask admin for correct server URL
4. Restart app

---

### "Server Not Ready"

**What it means**: Server is reachable but not ready to process  

**Check:**
1. Just started server? Wait 10-15 seconds for GPU initialization
2. Is GPU properly detected? (Ask admin)

**Try:**
1. Wait 30 seconds and tap Refresh
2. Ask admin to check server logs
3. Ask admin to restart server

---

### "Camera permission denied"

**What it means**: App doesn't have camera access  

**Fix:**
1. Go to phone Settings
2. Tap Apps or Applications
3. Find "3D Measurement" app
4. Tap Permissions
5. Enable Camera
6. Return to app and restart

---

### "Processing timeout"

**What it means**: Server took too long to process  

**Reasons:**
- First measurement (normal - GPU warmup)
- Server busy with other request
- Too many/large images

**Try:**
1. Wait full 3 minutes for first measurement
2. Recapture with better lighting
3. Contact admin if persists

---

### Low Confidence Score (<40%)

**What it means**: Measurements may not be accurate  

**Common causes:**
- Poor lighting
- Incomplete 360° coverage
- Inconsistent distance
- Object too reflective/transparent
- Cluttered background

**Fix:**
1. Review "Tips for Best Results" section above
2. Recapture with:
   - Better lighting
   - Complete circle walk
   - Consistent distance
   - Plain background
3. For critical measurements, capture again and compare

---

## 📋 Quick Reference

### Capture Checklist
Before starting capture:
- [ ] Object on stable surface
- [ ] Plain background
- [ ] Good lighting
- [ ] Clear space around object (1-2m circle)
- [ ] You're standing 50-70cm away
- [ ] Object fully visible in camera

During capture:
- [ ] Walk in smooth circle
- [ ] Same distance throughout
- [ ] Same height throughout
- [ ] Complete full 360°
- [ ] Let app capture automatically (30 seconds)

---

### When to Recapture

Recapture if:
- Confidence score < 40%
- Measurements seem obviously wrong
- You moved too fast
- Didn't complete full circle
- Lighting was poor
- You changed distance during capture

---

### Expected Accuracy

**With good technique:**
- Confidence: 20-40%
- Accuracy: ±5-15% (before calibration)
- Accuracy: ±2-5% (after calibration with known dimension)

**Best practices:**
- Multiple captures of same object
- Average the results
- Use manual calibration if available

---

## 🎯 Typical Workflow

### For Routine Measurements:
1. Open app (5 seconds)
2. Check server ready (automatic)
3. Tap Start Measurement
4. Position object and self
5. Tap Start Auto-Capture
6. Walk in circle (30 seconds)
7. Wait for processing (60-90 seconds)
8. View results
9. Tap New Measurement for next object

**Total time per object: ~2-3 minutes**

---

### For Critical Measurements:
1. Set up object carefully (good lighting, plain background)
2. Capture once (2-3 minutes)
3. Note results
4. Capture again (2-3 minutes)
5. Compare results
6. If similar (within 5%), average them
7. If different (>10%), capture third time
8. Use median of three captures

**Total time: 6-10 minutes for high confidence**
