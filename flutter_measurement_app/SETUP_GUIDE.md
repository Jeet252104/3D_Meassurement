   - Enable "USB Debugging"
3. Connect device via USB
4. Verify connection:
   ```bash
   flutter devices
   ```

### Step 3: Start Backend Server
On your computer:
```bash
cd C:\Users\harsh\Downloads\3D-measurement-main\3D-measurement-main
python main.py serve --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Step 4: Find Your Computer's IP
**Windows:**
```cmd
ipconfig
```
Look for "IPv4 Address" (e.g., 192.168.1.100)

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
ifconfig
```
Look for "inet" address

### Step 5: Run the App
```bash
flutter run
```

### Step 6: Configure API in App
1. Once app launches, tap **Settings** icon (top right)
2. Enter your server URL: `http://YOUR_IP:8000`
3. Tap **Test Connection**

## 📸 How to Use

### Capturing Measurements:

1. **Home Screen**:
   - Check server status (should show green "Server Ready")
   - Tap "View Instructions" to see capture guidelines
   - Tap "Start Measurement"

2. **Camera Screen**:
   - Position object in frame (50-70cm away)
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Tap "Start Auto-Capture"
   - Walk slowly in a complete circle around object
   - 20 photos will be captured automatically (30 seconds)

3. **Processing**:
   - Photos compress and upload automatically
   - Server processes images (60-90 seconds)
   - Progress shown on screen

4. **Results**:
   - View measurements: Width, Height, Depth
   - See volume and surface area
   - Check confidence score
   - Tap "New Measurement" to start again

## 🎯 Capture Tips for Accuracy

### ✅ DO:
- **Lighting**: Use bright, even lighting
- **Distance**: Maintain 50-70cm distance
- **Coverage**: Complete full 360° circle
- **Speed**: Walk slowly and steadily
- **Stability**: Hold phone steady
- **Background**: Use plain background
- **Height**: Keep camera at same height

### ❌ DON'T:
- Move too fast
- Change distance during capture
- Use dim or harsh lighting
- Skip parts of the circle
- Capture reflective/transparent objects
- Use cluttered background

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Change Number of Images

Edit `lib/utils/constants.dart`:
```dart
static const int recommendedImages = 20;  // Change to 10-30
```

### Change Capture Speed

Edit `lib/utils/constants.dart`:
```dart
static const Duration captureInterval = Duration(milliseconds: 1500);  // 1.5 seconds
```

### Change Image Quality

Edit `lib/utils/constants.dart`:
```dart
static const int imageMaxWidth = 1024;  // Max width in pixels
static const int imageQuality = 85;     // JPEG quality (0-100)
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot connect to server"

**Check:**
- [ ] Server is running: `python main.py serve`
- [ ] Phone and computer on same WiFi
- [ ] IP address is correct in app settings
- [ ] Firewall allows port 8000
- [ ] Test in phone browser: `http://YOUR_IP:8000`

**Fix:**
```bash
# On computer, verify server
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Should return: {"status":"healthy", ...}
```

---

### "Camera permission denied"

**Fix:**
1. Go to Settings → Apps → 3D Measurement
2. Tap Permissions
3. Enable Camera
4. Restart app

---

### "Server Not Ready"

**Check:**
```bash
# On computer
python main.py info

# Should show:
# GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650
# CUDA: 12.1
# Status: Ready
```

**Fix:**
- Wait 10-15 seconds after starting (GPU initialization)
- Check GPU is detected: See `FIX_CUDA.md` in parent directory
- Review server logs for errors

---

### "Processing timeout"

**Causes:**
- Normal for first measurement (GPU warmup)
- Too many images
- Server overloaded

**Fix:**
- Wait full 3 minutes for first measurement
- Reduce image count to 10-15
- Check server logs
- Restart server

---

### "Low confidence results"

**Causes:**
- Poor lighting
- Incomplete coverage
- Inconsistent distance
- Reflective object

**Fix:**
- Recapture with better lighting
- Ensure full 360° circle
- Maintain consistent 50-70cm distance
- Try different object
